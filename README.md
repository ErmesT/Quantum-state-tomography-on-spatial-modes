This repository contains up-to-date 3D designs and software required to operate the roto-flip stages.
As bugs are found and rectified new versions of the relevant files will be uploaded here.

Detailed instructions of the contents of this archive are inside the individual compressed files.
More information about the supplied LabVIEW and Arduino code is available within the notes.pdf file.

Code 1-4 folders contain the LabVIEW programmes to automate the tomography experiment, optimise the choice of the pixel coordinates for the projection measurement, the Arduino firmware for the roto-flip stages, the 3D-design files of all components of the stages, and the video of the syste in action performing an automated state tomography measurement.

Discalimer: The authors are not responsible for any damage, intentional or non-intentional, related to the use of any of the contents of this repository, which is provided 'as is'.
